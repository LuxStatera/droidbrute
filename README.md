#Droidbrute
An Android PIN cracking USB rubber ducky payload made efficient with a statistically generated wordlist.

##What it does
Cracks the password on Android devices with an insecure 4-digit PIN set. The script is a USB rubber duck payload that emulates a keyboard to type in the most statistically common 4-digit PINs. By working from most common PIN to least common the speed at which the phone can be cracked is greately increased.
